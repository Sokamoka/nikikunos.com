My first collection is called: “Lets celebrate with cakes”(1/1)
It is a limited edition of custom-made cakes with portraits for happy NFT holders to celebrate their favorite NFTs.

In this summer I will launch my first generative collection. I have so many surprises for you that include a little bit of animation and a little bit of home! Stay tuned for more info!

My name is Niki S. Kunos and I am a cake decorator in IRL. In the last 10 years my cakes proud to be featured on Huffington Post Wedding, Ruffled Blog, The Modern Wedding Magazine (20th-anniversary edition), Insyle Magazine, Glamour Mag and I was finalist “Decorator of the Year!” on Australian Cake Decorating Network (2014) but most importantly, I have been able to feed over 10,000 happy people with my creations.

Here in WEB3, it is amazing that i could combine cake decorating with my other passion, illustration.

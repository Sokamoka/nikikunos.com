            We all are Baby from Dirty Dancing, who carried a watermelon and
            found a totally different world. First steps into WEB3 is not easy,
            but if you are curious enough you will find a genuine and supportive
            community. Carrying the cake is like opening the door to Narnia into
            a secret world full of colorful and endless possibilities. Together
            with our community members, we would like to support women-led
            project. We will decide together what new upcoming project to
            support each quarter with 10% of the collection’s revenue. We will
            purchase from the voted collections, which we giveaway among our
            members. We are here to lift each other up. WAGMI
